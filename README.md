OAuth2 For Humans
=================

It supports both 'installed app' and 'service account' flows. The user can use
each of these seamlessly.

The use case is to simplify supporting a client app to use either a role account
(via a private key) or impersonate a user (via a client key). HTTP token renewal
is done automatically and transparently.
